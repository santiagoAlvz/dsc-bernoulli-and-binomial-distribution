You'll notice that these distributions formalize a lot of the theory you learned in the probability theory section! \n","\n","\n","## Objectives\n","\n","You will be able to:\n","\n","* Describe the components of a Bernoulli distribution\n","* Describe how a Binomial Distribution is related to a Bernoulli Distribution\n","* Use `numpy` to randomly generate Binomial and Bernoulli trials\n","* Use `matplotlib` to show the output of generated Binomial and Bernoulli trials\n","\n","\n","## The Bernoulli or Binary distribution\n","\n","In the previous sections, we discussed several probability theory situations regarding throwing a dice or flipping a coin. The Bernoulli distribution is a discrete distribution that formalizes the idea of a coin flip. \n","\n","The Bernoulli experiment is a simple experiment in which there is a binary\n","outcome: 0-1, success-failure, heads-tails, etc. \n","\n","If we were to model a coin flip with a Bernoulli distribution, we could say that 0 means heads, and 1 tails. With a fair coin, obtaining either value when performing a coin toss would have an assigned probability of 0.5. The Bernoulli experiment can also describe events with different probability structures. For example, let's say that the chance of scoring a penalty goal is 80%. Where $Y$ is the penalty outcome:\n","\n","$Y = Bernoulli(p)$ and $p=P(Y=1)=0.8$.\n","\n","The distribution is defined by 1 parameter, the parameter $p$, describing the chance of \"success\".\n","\n","Let's look at the PMF and the CDF when $p=0.8$.\n","\n","<img src=\"images/bernoulli_plot.png\" width =\"300\">\n","\n","As you can see these functions look pretty straightforward when you plot them.\n","\n","Now, what is the mean and the variance of these functions? Recall that\n","\n","\n","$E(X) = \\mu = \\sum_i p(x_i)x_i= 0.2*0+0.8*1=0.8$\n","\n","$ E((X-\\mu)^2) = \\sigma^2 = \\sum_i p(x_i)(x_i-\\mu)^2 = 0.2*(-0.8)^2+0.8*(0.2)^2 = (0.8*0.2)*(0.2+0.8) = 0.16$\n","\n","A general rule for the Bernoulli distribution is that: $E(X)=p$ and $\\sigma^2=p*(1-p)$.\n","\n","Note how the Bernoulli distribution describes a single coin flip, a single penalty shot, etc. What if we repeat this process multiple times and are interested in the probability of obtaining a certain number of 1s/successes/tails? This process is described by the **binomial distribution**.\n","\n","## The Binomial distribution\n","\n","The binomial distribution describes the process of performing $n$ *independent* Bernoulli trials. So what does it mean that the trials are independent?\n","\n","When we say that events are **independent, this means that an event is not affected by previous events**.\n","\n","Applying this to our penalty goal example, this means that the assumption is that, when a soccer player misses a penalty and then tries again, the fact that he missed it the previous time does not affect his chances of making it now: the probability is still 80% ($p=0.8$)!\n","\n","\n","As we have a repeated Bernoulli experiment, the binomial distribution has two parameters: $p$ (the success probability) and $n$ (the number of times the experiment is repeated). We say that random variable $Y$ follows a Binomial distribution:\n","$ Y = bin(n, p)$. \n","\n","\n","Now we're interested in finding an expression that gives us the probability to find each possible amount of successes $k$ between 0 and n. Going back to our goal penalties example, imagine we still have $p = 0.8$, but have 3 consecutive penalty shots. What is:\n","- $P(Y=0)$ (or the soccer player doesn't score a single time)?\n","- $P(Y=1)$ (or the soccer player scores exactly once)?\n","- $P(Y=2)$ (or the soccer player scores exactly twice)?\n","- $P(Y=3)$ (or the soccer player scores exactly three times)?\n","\n","\n","Calculating $P(Y=0)$ is pretty easy, it's simply $0.2*0.2*0.2$, so 0.008. \n","\n","Getting to $P(Y=1)$ is a little bit more complicated. It's essentially $0.8*0.2*0.2+0.2*0.8*0.2+ 0.2*0.2*0.8$, so it's the probability of scoring during the first shot, or the second shot, or the third shot. So essentially, its $3*(0.8*0.2*0.2)$. You can see how combinatorics play a role here! The general formula is given as follows:\n","\n","$$ P(Y=k)= \\binom{n}{k} p^k(1-p)^{(n-k)}$$ \n","\n","\n","Where $k$ denotes the number of successes. Applying this on $P(Y=2)$ we get $$ P(Y=2)= \\binom{3}{2} 0.8^2(1-0.8)^{(3-2)} = \\dfrac{3!}{2!1!}*0.8^2 * 0.2^1 = 3*0.8^2*0.2$$ Repeating this for the other discrete values between 0 and 3, you get:\n","\n","- $P(Y=0)=0.008$\n","- $P(Y=1)=0.096 $ \n","- $P(Y=2)=0.384 $ \n","- $P(Y=3)=0.512$ \n","\n","\n","Note how they sum to one, which is exactly what's expected! Let's look at their PMF and CDF.\n","\n","\n","<img src=\"images/binomial_pl.png\" width =\"500\">\n","\n","\n","Just like before, let's look at the mean and variance:\n","\n","$E(X) = \\mu = \\sum_i p(x_i)x_i= 0.008*0+0.096*1+0.384*2+0.512*3 = 2.4 $\n","\n","$ E((X-\\mu)^2) = \\sigma^2 = \\sum_i p(x_i)(x_i-\\mu)^2 =0.008*(-2.4)^2+0.096*(-1.4)^2+ 0.384*(-0.4)^2+0.512 *0.6^2 = 0.48$\n","\n","\n","Very similarly to Bernoulli, a general rule for the Binomial distribution is that: $E(X)=n*p$ and $\\sigma^2=n*p*(1-p)$. You simply multiply your results with the number of trials $n$!\n","\n","## Use NumPy to randomly generate Binomial and Bernoulli trials.\n","\n","In the first part, you learned about Bernoulli and Binomial using their formulas to obtain the probability distributions.\n","You can also perform random sampling. What you're basically doing then is selecting a sample from a statistical population in a way that every possible sample has a predetermined probability of being selected.\n","\n","Applied to our example, imagine that 1 represents scoring a penalty goal and 0 represents missing. If $p = 0.8$, if you take 100 penalty shots in a row, you'd expect to score about 80 goals. The reason why it's not exactly 80 is because uncertainty plays a role, and this is exactly what you can model using the NumPy random library!
